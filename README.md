BorgBackup with borgmatic Client
=========
![CI](https://github.com/jprltsnz/ansible-role-borgmatic/workflows/CI/badge.svg)


Sets up borgmatic to make per-application backups with optional encryption and compression. Currently supports Debian/Ubuntu and CentOS/Red Hat.

Mainly based of https://github.com/borgbase/ansible-role-borgbackup, but this role is a little more flexible and doesn't support borgbase.


Requirements
------------
The `respositories` parent directory from borgmatic_configs need to exist, or this role will fail.

Role Variables
--------------
- `borgmatic_init_encryption`: The encryption algorithm to use see https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/set-up-backups/#initialization by default it is set no `none`
`borgmatic_timer`: The `borgmatic.timer`'s `OnCalendar` value.
`borgmatic_configs`: A dict with the contents of borgmatic per application configuration file. This is copied verbatim to the borgmatic config folder. This role is set for per-application setup (https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/) See https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/reference/configuration/ for a complete list of available configuration.

Dependencies
------------
This role requires `geerlingguy.repo-epel` to be installed â€” it will called appropriately when needed.
